# Hack Wiki

[![Open Source Love](https://firstcontributions.github.io/open-source-badges/badges/open-source-v1/open-source.svg)](https://github.com/firstcontributions/open-source-badges)

This repo stores what I learned, what you can learn to know how to start hacking career. However you should have knowledge about basic coding and popular algorithms.

Notes: some slides in this repo come from my course so that they are written in Vietnamese. Maybe they are out-of-date. So if you want to contribute, feel free to pull request.

### Roadmap

---

### Database

It is a essential part of application.

#### Introduction database

What will you learn in this module:
- Analyze, explore data in database.
- How to build, manage application - make suitable diagram, relationship, query (is it standard?). 

---

### Computer architecture 

This show how computer process works inside.

#### Introduction architecture

What will learn in this part:
- Parts, mechanism, performance of computer.
- How computer excutes commands.
- Optimizing coding skills to improve speed of programs.

Note: you can read `Computer Organization And Design 5th Edition 2014` to improve your knowledge.

### Basic network security

This module is one of fundenmental security part, you should learn before start go to module Web exploit, Forensics and Reverse engineering.

#### Introduction Netsec

What will you learn in this module:
- About popular threats.
- Basic vulnerabilities in network.
- Goal: know how to attack-defense, build hacking mindset.(I wrote some ideas to start [here](https://github.com/Trumpiter-max/Tricks-in-web-exploiting#what-is-actually-hacking)) 

Preknowledge you should have before beginning:
- [Computer architecture] - how computer works.
- Basic knowledge about network.
- Know how to code in Python and Golang.
- Linux fundenmental.

How to improve your performance in this module:
- Read book, some ideas and labs coming from `[SEED book] Wenliang Du (2019). Computer & internet security: A hands-on approach, 2nd edition, ISBN-13: 978-
1733003933` and `[CS book] William Stallings and Lawrie Brown (2018). Computer Security: Principles and Practice, 4th Edition, ISBN 978-0-13-479410-5.`
- Read papers and CVEs in recent years.
- Practice and practice more. Some recommended place you can learned [SEED Lab](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/), [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/), CTFs - Box machine ([Hack the box](https://www.hackthebox.com/), [Root me](https://www.root-me.org/?lang=en)), [CEH](https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/), [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/), Online coure ([Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/))
