### Basic network security

This module is one of fundenmental security part, you should learn before start go to module Web exploit, Forensics and Reverse engineering.

#### Introduction

What will you learn in this module:
- About popular threats.
- Basic vulnerabilities in network.
- Goal: know how to attack-defense, build hacking mindset.(I wrote some ideas to start [here](https://github.com/Trumpiter-max/Tricks-in-web-exploiting#what-is-actually-hacking)) 

Preknowledge you should have before beginning:
- Computer architecture - how computer works.
- Basic knowledge about network.
- Know how to code in Python and Golang.
- Linux fundenmental.

How to improve your performance in this module:
- Read book, some ideas and labs coming from book1 and book2.
- Read papers and CVEs in recent years.
- Practice and practice more.
